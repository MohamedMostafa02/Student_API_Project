# Student API

A simple ASP.NET Core Web API to manage students, including retrieving student lists, filtering passed students, calculating average grades, and performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student data.

‚úÖ Features
- Get all students
- Get passed students (grade >= 50)
- Get average grade of all students
- Get student by ID
- Add a new student
- Update an existing student
- Delete a student by ID

üß† How It Works
- The API exposes several endpoints under the base route /api/Students.
- Uses in-memory data simulation (StudentDataSimultion.StudentList) as the data source.
- Supports RESTful HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- Validates input data and returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
  200 OK for successful requests,
  201 Created when a new student is added,
  400 Bad Request for invalid data or parameters,
  404 Not Found when a student or resource is not found.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Clone the repository or add the StudentsController class to your ASP.NET Core Web API project.
2. Ensure you have a StudentDataSimultion class with a StudentList in-memory collection.
3. Build and run the project.
4. Access the endpoints using tools like Postman or your HTTP client.
5. Example base URL: https://localhost:{port}/api/Students
